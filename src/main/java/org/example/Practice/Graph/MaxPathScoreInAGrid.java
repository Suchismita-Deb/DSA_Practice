// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-path-score-in-a-grid/description/

// You are given an m x n grid where each cell contains one of the values 0, 1, or 2. You are also given an integer k.
//
//You start from the top-left corner (0, 0) and want to reach the bottom-right corner (m - 1, n - 1) by moving only right or down.
//
//Each cell contributes a specific score and incurs an associated cost, according to their cell values:
//
//0: adds 0 to your score and costs 0.
//1: adds 1 to your score and costs 1.
//2: adds 2 to your score and costs 1.
//Return the maximum score achievable without exceeding a total cost of k, or -1 if no valid path exists.
//
//Note: If you reach the last cell but the total cost exceeds k, the path is invalid.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: grid = [[0, 1],[2, 0]], k = 1
//
//Output: 2
//
//Explanation.
// The optimal path is:
//
//Cell	grid[i][j]	Score	Total
//Score	Cost	Total
//Cost
//(0, 0)	0	0	0	0	0
//(1, 0)	2	2	2	1	1
//(1, 1)	0	0	2	0	1
//Thus, the maximum possible score is 2.
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input: grid = [[0, 1],[1, 2]], k = 1
//
//Output: -1
//
//Explanation:
//
//There is no path that reaches cell (1, 1) without exceeding cost k. Thus, the answer is -1.
public class MaxPathScoreInAGrid {
    /*
    The first is I was thinking in terms of vis array and going dfs in all point. It ony need to start form 0,0.
    Need to take care of cost and it should not exceed k and i and j and score. memo[i][j][cost] =  maximum score achievable reaching cell (i,j) with total cost = cost. cost>k stop. cost range 0 to k+1.
